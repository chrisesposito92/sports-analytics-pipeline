    "\n",
    "From our exploratory analysis, we can draw several conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a strong correlation between point differential and win rate, which makes intuitive sense.\n",
    "2. Teams tend to perform better at home than away, as evidenced by the home win rate being higher than the away win rate.\n",
    "3. Some teams show significant differences in their home versus away performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps for our analytics pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build more advanced features that capture team form and momentum.\n",
    "2. Engineer features that account for head-to-head matchups and historical performance.\n",
    "3. Develop a predictive model using the engineered features to forecast game outcomes.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's performance and refine it as needed.\n",
    "5. Create a dashboard for visualizing predictions and team analytics."
